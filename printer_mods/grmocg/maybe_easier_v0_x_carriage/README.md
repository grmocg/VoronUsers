MaybeEasier V0 X-Carriage
===================================

This replaces the X-carriage on the V0 with one that gives you the option to route the belt three different ways, and additionally has larger zip-tie holes, allowing the use of the more common "4-inch" or "100mm" zipties.

Essentially, this carriage lets you route the excess belt out to the side or diagonal to the side/front in addition to the option of putting the excess out the middle.
This is similar to another mod by Mike for which I cannot find a reference outside of discord at the moment.

Routing the excess belt out the side, so you can have a more easily resuable belt:

An alternate belt routing that is close to the default:

Another alternate belt routing that has the belt angling inward at the center:

A bigger ziptie hole so more sizes of zipties can be used:

Required hardware
-----------------

There is no additional required hardware-- other than printing some new plastic, you can just reuse the stock parts.
